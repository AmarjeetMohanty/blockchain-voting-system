# Blockchain Voting System

![Blockchain Voting System](https://github.com/AmarjeetMohanty/blockchain-voting-system/raw/main/images/voting_system.png)

This repository contains the source code and documentation for a blockchain-based voting system. The aim of this project is to provide a secure and transparent platform for conducting elections using blockchain technology.

## Features

- **Decentralized:** The system is built on a blockchain network, ensuring that no central authority has control over the voting process. This eliminates the risk of manipulation and fraud.

- **Transparency:** All transactions and votes are recorded on the blockchain, making the entire process transparent and publicly verifiable.

- **Security:** Blockchain technology provides robust security measures, making it extremely difficult for any unauthorized modifications to the data.

- **Immutable Audit Trail:** The voting system creates an immutable audit trail, allowing anyone to verify the integrity of the election results.

- **Anonymous Voting:** The system ensures the privacy of voters by keeping their identities anonymous. Only authorized entities can verify the authenticity of each vote.

- **Smart Contracts:** The voting process is implemented using smart contracts, which automatically execute predefined rules and conditions.

## Prerequisites

Before running the system, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Node.js (version 12 or above)
- Truffle (version 5 or above)
- Ganache CLI or Ganache GUI
- MetaMask extension (for browser-based interactions)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AmarjeetMohanty/blockchain-voting-system.git
   ```

2. Change to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd blockchain-voting-system
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Compile the smart contracts:

   ```bash
   truffle compile
   ```

5. Update the deployment configuration in `truffle-config.js` with your preferred network settings (e.g., Ganache, Infura, etc.).

6. Migrate the smart contracts to the blockchain network:

   ```bash
   truffle migrate
   ```

7. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

8. Access the application by opening `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have MetaMask installed and configured to connect to your preferred blockchain network.

2. Create a new account on the blockchain network and obtain some test Ether (if using a local development network like Ganache, you can use the default accounts).

3. Connect MetaMask to the blockchain network.

4. Open the web application in your browser.

5. Create an election by providing the necessary details (e.g., election name, candidate names, start and end date).

6. Cast your vote by selecting the desired candidate.

7. Monitor the progress of the election and view the results.
